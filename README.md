# NewsFlux
Personalized News Aggregator App

# **Stock Market News Aggregation Application**

## **Overview**
This project involves building a full-fledged news aggregation service focused on stock market updates, specifically targeting keywords like **"stocks in news," "Nifty," "latest stock news,"** etc. Users can interact via text and voice using **OpenAI's real-time API** for **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** capabilities. The application is designed to fetch, filter, and present real-time news updates to users, making it useful for investors, traders, and anyone interested in financial news.

## **Key Features**
1. **News Aggregation**: Fetch real-time stock market news articles based on predefined or user-provided keywords such as **Nifty stocks**, **latest stock updates**, etc.
2. **Text & Audio Input**: Users can either type their query or provide voice commands using **Speech-to-Text (STT)** via OpenAI's API.
3. **Audio Output**: News summaries or articles can be converted into audio using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, allowing users to listen to the news.
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Push notifications or real-time updates for users when new articles related to their subscribed keywords are available.
5. **Personalized News Feeds**: Tailored news feeds based on user preferences (e.g., specific stocks, sectors, indices).
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: The ability to classify articles as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** to help users quickly assess market sentiment.
7. **Scalable System**: The system is designed for high availability and scalability to support many users.

## **System Design Architecture**

### **High-Level Architecture**

```plaintext
User -> (Voice or Text) -> Frontend (React) -> Backend (Node.js) -> News API
                                                           |
                                     Speech-to-Text API (OpenAI or Google)
                                                           |
                                          Text-to-Speech API (OpenAI)
```

### **Detailed Components**

1. **User Input**:
   - **Text Input**: Users can type their search query or keyword (e.g., "Nifty stock news").
   - **Voice Input**: Users can speak into their microphone. The **OpenAI Speech-to-Text API** will convert this into a text query.

2. **News Fetching**:
   - The query is processed by the **backend** and the system checks **Redis** for cached responses.
   - If no cache exists, the backend makes an API request to a **news provider** (e.g., NewsAPI, Yahoo Finance API) to fetch relevant articles based on the query.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Using **WebSockets**, the backend sends real-time notifications to the front-end when new news is available for the user's subscribed keywords or sectors.
   - This keeps users up-to-date without manually refreshing the page.

4. **Audio Output**:
   - Users can ask the system to **read** the news to them. The system sends the text summary of the news to the **OpenAI Text-to-Speech API**, which generates an audio file that is streamed back to the user.

5. **User Personalization**:
   - Users can subscribe to specific **keywords** (e.g., "Tesla," "Nifty50"), and the system will fetch news specifically related to these preferences.
   - This improves user engagement and experience by offering tailored content.

6. **Caching & Performance Optimization**:
   - **Redis** is used to cache frequently searched news articles, reducing the response time for users.
   - **MongoDB** stores user history, preferences, and article metadata for future recommendations.

7. **Cron Jobs for Background Tasks**:
   - Periodic background jobs fetch the latest stock market news to keep the database updated and ready for user queries.
   - These jobs can run every few minutes or based on specific triggers.

## **Backend Code Structure**

### **1. Server Setup (Node.js)**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const redis = require('redis');
const newsApi = require('./newsApi');  // News API integration
const openaiApi = require('./openaiApi');  // OpenAI integration
const cache = redis.createClient();  // Redis client setup

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Get news based on text or voice input
app.post('/getNews', async (req, res) => {
  const { query, isAudio, audioFile } = req.body;
  let searchQuery = query;

  // If audio input, convert it to text using OpenAI API
  if (isAudio) {
    searchQuery = await openaiApi.speechToText(audioFile);
  }

  // Check Redis cache for existing data
  cache.get(searchQuery, async (err, cachedData) => {
    if (cachedData) {
      return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedData));
    } else {
      // Fetch news from API
      const articles = await newsApi.fetchNewsByQuery(searchQuery);
      // Cache the response
      cache.set(searchQuery, JSON.stringify(articles), 'EX', 3600);  // Cache for 1 hour
      res.json(articles);
    }
  });
});

// Convert text to speech using OpenAI API
app.post('/textToSpeech', async (req, res) => {
  const { text } = req.body;
  const audioFile = await openaiApi.textToSpeech(text);
  res.json({ audioFile });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### **2. News Fetching Module (`newsApi.js`)**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const fetchNewsByQuery = async (query) => {
  const apiKey = process.env.NEWS_API_KEY;  // Your news API key
  const response = await axios.get(`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${query}&apiKey=${apiKey}`);
  return response.data.articles;
};

module.exports = { fetchNewsByQuery };
```

### **3. OpenAI Integration (`openaiApi.js`)**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const speechToText = async (audioFile) => {
  // Use OpenAI or Google API to convert audio to text
  const response = await axios.post('OPENAI_STT_ENDPOINT', { audioFile });
  return response.data.transcription;
};

const textToSpeech = async (text) => {
  // Use OpenAI API to convert text to speech
  const response = await axios.post('OPENAI_TTS_ENDPOINT', { text });
  return response.data.audioFile;
};

module.exports = { speechToText, textToSpeech };
```

---

## **Potential Improvements**
1. **Speech Recognition Accuracy**: OpenAI's Speech-to-Text is good, but integrating **Google’s Speech-to-Text API** might improve accuracy for complex financial terms.
2. **Advanced Personalization**: Implement machine learning models to better understand user behavior and provide more relevant recommendations.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Introduce a sentiment analysis model for better insights into market trends based on the tone of the articles.
4. **Performance Scaling**: Use **Kubernetes** for better container orchestration and scaling based on demand. Implement auto-scaling for peak traffic times (e.g., during market hours).

---

## **Conclusion**
This stock market news aggregation platform offers an innovative way to keep users informed about real-time financial events through voice and text interactions. The integration of OpenAI APIs adds a layer of accessibility and convenience, making it more engaging for users who are on the go or multitasking. By continuously refining the user experience with advanced personalization, sentiment analysis, and real-time updates, this application has the potential to stand out in the financial news market.

### **Next Steps**
- Set up the **Node.js** backend with API integrations.
- Implement the **React.js** front end with WebSocket support for real-time updates.
- Containerize the application using **Docker** and plan for cloud deployment.
- Run thorough testing for both **audio input/output** and **real-time news updates**.
